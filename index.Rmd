# Welcome {-}

Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread. Just as with punctuation, while there are many code styles to choose from, some are more reader-friendly than others. The style presented here, which is used throughout the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org), is derived from [Google's R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and has evolved considerably over the years.
